<h2>Story and Gameplay</h2>
<br>
<p>You are a knight of the realm, but alas, the Princess has been kidnapped by a Dragon!  The Dragon's lair is a nearby abandoned castle, but you don't know which one.

The player always spawns in the same initial castle location.  The boss (Dragon) however, spawns randomly in one of the other castles.  The boss will never spawn in the same castle as the player.  The goal of the game is to explore the map to find the castle where the boss is, and to defeat him.  

The player starts with three potions.  Potions can only be used in combat.  Using a potion ends the players phase in combat (even if the player doesn't have any more potions), but a potion heals the player back to max health.

Anytime on the world map the player may sleep. This heals the player back to max health and is useful to do between battles.</p>
