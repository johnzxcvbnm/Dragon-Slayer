          <h3>About Dragon Slayer</h3>
          <h3>By John Kusching</h3>
          <!-- Content -->
          <p>This is a game I made as my first project while attending General Assembly.  I wanted to make a more old school game like the NES days and I modeled it off of one of my favorite NES games, Dragon Warrior.  I would define this game as a 'sudo' RPG, because although it plays as an RPG, there is no actual character progression.  You can never change your weapon or armor, and there isn't any XP or leveling up in this game.  But all that helps me keep the game pretty simple, which is what I wanted, simplicity.  I didn't want to bog down the player with too much story or too confusing battle sequences.  "Slay the Dragon, Rescue the Princess" - Simple right.<br></p>
          <p>There were two big features that I wanted to impliment and freely switch between. The first one was the ability to walk around on a map, but with a limited view point.  The actual map size is 50x50 squares (or tiles) whereas your field of view is only 15x9.  Every time you move re-renders your field of view.<br></p>
          <p>The other major part of the game was the combat.  I kept it simple.  An attack, a heal, and a run.  I also tested out the monsters to do specific things.  The Slime is the push over enemy.  The Wizard is the low-mid range enemy to cause some damage.  The Skeleton is designed to force the player to use a potion (which they can never get back).  The Dragon (boss) is designed to be difficult (I usually needed at least two potions to maybe survive).<br></p>
